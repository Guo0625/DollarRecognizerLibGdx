An implementation of "$1 Unistroke Recognizer" (http://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/dollar/)
for libgdx based on the original js source :D
The current implementation uses the Protractor formula which renders the algorithm faster.


For the time being, it will published as a snippet, later on it will composed as a library :P

TODO:
* Add support for loading gestures from Json files, something like:
  - addGestureFromFile(FileHandle ...),
  - addGesturesFromFile(FileHandle ...);
* Make the recognizer run threaded if possible for each template gesture.
* Seperate further into smaller classes.
* Modify the settings via getter/setter methods.
* Make the recognizer more event driven maybe provided as extra function.
* Write an utility for generating gestures.
* Provide links to the original js source, website and papers (Done!).
* Provide sample gestures as Json files.
* Add a working example.
* Pack to a damn jar!


REQUIREMENTS:
libgdx: any revision from svn that contains Json support (pretty recent).
